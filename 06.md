# WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 

* Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model 
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, 
variables and functions take on new names. 

## IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME 
KNOWN AS PROPERTIES 
* If a variable is part of an object, it is called a 
property. Properties tell us about the object, such as 
the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has. 
Each individual hotel might have a different name 
and a different number of rooms. 

## IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME 
KNOWN AS METHODS 
* If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. 
Methods represent tasks that are associated with 
the object. For example, you can check how many 
rooms are available by subtracting the number of 
booked rooms from the total number of rooms.

# Document Object Model

* The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies 
how browsers should create a model of an HTML 
page and how JavaScript can access and update the 
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
* The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules. 
It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas:
